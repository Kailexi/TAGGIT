# Project: TAGGIT

### What is TAGGIT?

**TAGGIT** is a game built on **Unreal Engine 5**, reimagining the classic childhood game of tag. At its core, the rules are simple: chase or run. What's our twist? In one of the game modes your opponent is an **adaptive AI**, powered by an open-source ML library.
This AI learns from your moves, adapts to your playstyle, and refines its own strategy. This means every match feels dynamic and fluid

## Gameplay & Features:
### Extensive Movement
A stamina based movement system that incorporates sprinting, jumping, leaping, tagging and card-based movement abilities, e.g a tongue hook that allows you to traverse terrain quickly and tag opponets!

### Card-Boost System  
To balance gameplay and introduce tactical depth, TAGGIT includes a **card-boost** system (currently WIP). These cards grant temporary buffs and open paths for strategic decision-making ‚Äî layering strategy over reflex-based action.

### Game Modes:  
 **PvP** ‚Äî Face off against other players online and test your skills and reflexes.  
 **Survival** ‚Äî Every few minutes, new AI-powered bots spawn. Can you survive the onslaught?  
 **1-v-1** ‚Äî Quick duels against either players or AI-bots.
