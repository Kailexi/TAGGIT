# Project: TAGGIT

### What is TAGGIT?

**TAGGIT** is a game built on **Unreal Engine 5**, reimagining the classic childhood game of tag. At its core, the rules are simple: chase or run. What's the twist? Your opponent is an **adaptive AI**, powered by an open-source ML library.
This AI doesnâ€™t follow scripted paths or can be predicted â€” it learns from your moves, adapts to your playstyle, and refines its own strategy. This means every match feels unpredictable, dynamic, and full of surprises.

## Gameplay & Features:
### Extensive Movement
A stamina based movement system that incorporates sprinting, jumping, dashing, tagging, card-based movement abilities and a tongue hook that allows you to traverse terrain quickly!

### Card-Boost System  
To balance gameplay and introduce tactical depth, TAGGIT includes a **card-boost** system (currently WIP). These cards grant temporary buffs and open paths for strategic decision-making â€” layering strategy over reflex-based action.

### Game Modes:  
- **PvP** â€” Face off against other players online and test your skills and reflexes.  
- **Survival** â€” Every few minutes, new AI bots spawn. Can you survive the onslaught?  
- **One-on-One** â€” Quick duels against either players or bots.
